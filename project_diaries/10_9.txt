Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        research machine learning as applies to book recs
        refactor flask routes to use Flask-login
        scrape metadata?
        scrape reviews?

    indiv books page:
        add summary
        add genre graphing information

    books page:
        make books sortable by attribute

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        add error handling for when the user tries to add a genre that is already in their favs
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive

    write tests

12:30-2
    meet with Michelle, have lunch

2:30-3 career strategy session

3-4pm
    researching natural language processing - Textblob looks good for analyzing reviews
    researching other books APIs - none look very good
    do i really need to rate genres' similarities to each other?
    books are often tagged as similar genres
    seems like the problem is too MANY genre tags, not too few

5pm
    talked with Henry about next sprint steps
    decided on adding textual analysis of the reviews using sci-kit - see Henry's spam example
    are there commonalities between all good books and all bad books
    if you add a new text of a review, what stars will it be?
    if you add two books together, what comes out?

Tmo: scrape reviews, modify model to include reviews and summary of book
