Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        apply Henry's example to my reviews
        refactor flask routes to use Flask-login

    indiv books page:
        add genre graphing information

    books page:
        make books sortable by attribute
        make search feature

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        add error handling for when the user tries to add a genre that is already in their favs
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive

    write tests

11am
    scrummed
    seeded db with reviews and summaries!
    put summary on books page
    made avg_rating be a float in postgres and sql-al, rather than integer
    summaries are repeating some text
12pm
    fixed a problem where the titles from the review page weren't matching up
    to the titles from the book page
    had to scrape and reseed

1-2 lunch

2pm
    trying to understand classifier

3pm
    got classifier working, i think
    getting some data that looks right, but there is a lot of noise
    think more books and more reviews should help with that

4pm
    spent quite a bit of time investigating why there are missing reviews
    it's because the title of the book on the review page is in another language
    that's good actually because it will eliminate a lot of the non-English reviews

    trying to reseed database with medium-rated books to check important words from reviews
