Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
most impt - make recommendation engine
    books page:
        modify all books page to allow user to rate a book by clicking on it
        edit name of super long book names to be on multiple lines
        make books sortable by attribute

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive
        modify addGenres to add the genre the user just faved w/o having to refresh

    write tests

12pm -
    scrummed
    emailed Michelle back
    came up with a genres-only recommendation algorithm
    did some sample queries

1-2 lunch

2pm
    trying to implement algorithm
    fixed Unicode/Decode error by setting pythonioencoding variable to utf-8 -- export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8
        have to restart the env or restart the bash profile to make the change  -- source ~/.bashrc

3pm, 4pm
    got a simple algorithm to work!!!!
    got the Unicode/Decode error again even though the env variable is still set to utf-8 (???)
    returns a book if the book's genres match the user's genres exactly
        OR if the book's and user's genres have at least one genre in common
    took break 4:20-5

5pm
    refined algorithm to only recommend a book if the user and the book have two or more genres in common
    modified addGenres to add the genre the user just faved w/o having to refresh
