Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        visualize feature words
        write tests
        integrate ratings into rec algorithm

    genres page:
        make genre graph better - what info am i trying to convey?


if have time:
    fix summary repeating problem
    add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
    figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive
    make books sortable by attribute
    make letters match regardless of capitalization
        use regex if time -- http://xion.io/post/code/sqlalchemy-regex-filters.html
    refactor flask routes to use Flask-login


12pm
    review words with mix of highly rated and mediumly rated books actually look worse
    think the data is just more muddled when there are an uneven number of positive and negative ratings
    i should focus on visualization rather than making tweaks to the machine learning
    successfully selected only the number of genres with greater than 50 books -sidestepped SQL

1-2 lunch

2pm
    trying to get colors to generate dynamically
    success!

3pm
    checked in w/Henry
    i am good with the amount of progress
    want to try highlighting words in a review

4pm
    got classifier to work in Python
    wrote feature words to review_words.json
    found out that the feature words are very scattered in the reviews - each review has maybe one or two
        Madame Bovary is there because not only is the book itself on the list, but three or four other classics that reference it. And people like to compare characters in their reviews.
