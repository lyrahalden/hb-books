Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

Goals for today:
    modify all books page to allow user to rate a book by clicking on it
    modify user page to be able to choose a genre to add to their favorite genres (aka UserGenres)
    edit name of super long book names to be on multiple lines


12pm
    -created ajax route to get any genres from the server- not working
    - not sure of the best way to get successive rows from the db - limit/offset with counters? or pagination? what is pagination?

1-2 lunch

2pm
    asked Kiko about ajax call
    found out must jsonify genres manually in the flask route - done
    found out using limit and offset to paginate should work
    also found out must pass a counter through the ajax get request to update the offset parameter
    keep getting a TypeError when trying to pass data through an ajax get or post request

3pm
    figured out counter with Agne
