Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

Goals for today:
    modify all books page to allow user to rate a book by clicking on it
    modify user page to be able to choose a genre to add to their favorite genres (aka UserGenres)
    edit name of super long book names to be on multiple lines


12pm
    -created ajax route to get any genres from the server- not working
    - not sure of the best way to get successive rows from the db - limit/offset with counters? or pagination? what is pagination?

1-2 lunch

2pm
    asked Kiko about ajax call
    found out must jsonify genres manually in the flask route - done
    found out using limit and offset to paginate should work
    also found out must pass a counter through the ajax get request to update the offset parameter
    keep getting a TypeError when trying to pass data through an ajax get or post request

3pm
    figured out counter with Agne
    emailed Michelle

4pm
    together with Kiko, got the ajax call for adding a user genre to work

5pm
    general moral support
    added link to homepage in base at top
    added all_users page back in for ease of development
    fixed registration form


To do:
    books page:
        modify all books page to allow user to rate a book by clicking on it
        edit name of super long book names to be on multiple lines

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive

    write tests
