Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        apply Henry's example to my reviews
        refactor flask routes to use Flask-login

    indiv books page:
        add genre graphing information

    books page:
        make books sortable by attribute
        make search feature

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive

    write tests

12pm
    scrummed
    seeded database with books from the medium list
    reclassified reviews - the words are a lot more indicative of quality now, without the 3 star reviews.
    does this model use stop words? figured out it doesn't, added them in, not much changed
    added n-gram of 2, 3 - nothing changed

1-2 lunch

2pm
    fixed error handling for if a user has already added a genre to their list of favs - no more "nope" button!

3pm
    trying to figure out jquery autocomplete

4pm
    figured it out sort of
