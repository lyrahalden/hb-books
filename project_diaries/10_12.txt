Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        apply Henry's example to my reviews
        refactor flask routes to use Flask-login

    genres page:
        add genre graph using chart.js

    indiv books page:
        fix summary repeating problem

    books page:
        make books sortable by attribute

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive

    write tests

12pm
    scrummed
    seeded database with books from the medium list
    reclassified reviews - the words are a lot more indicative of quality now, without the 3 star reviews.
    does this model use stop words? figured out it doesn't, added them in, not much changed
    added n-gram of 2, 3 - nothing changed

1-2 lunch

2pm
    fixed error handling for if a user has already added a genre to their list of favs - no more "nope" button!

3pm
    trying to figure out jquery autocomplete

4pm
    figured it out sort of
    still fills the box with what you've clicked on
    looking into alternate autocomplete libraries

5pm
    read about autocomplete and search libraries
    read about chart.js
