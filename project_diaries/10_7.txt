Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
most impt - make recommendation engine
    books page:
        modify all books page to allow user to rate a book by clicking on it
        edit name of super long book names to be on multiple lines
        make books sortable by attribute

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive
        modify addGenres to add the genre the user just faved w/o having to refresh

    write tests

11:30am
    scrummed
    fixed ajax selector so that it selected the right element and passed the correct text to the db
    now working on using Jquery.remove to remove the genre button properly
    also the formatting for adding a new faved genre has gotten screwed up

12pm
    fixed ajax bugs - will have to rely on bootstrap to make formatting look nicer later
    MVP is complete!
