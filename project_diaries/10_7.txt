Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        scrape more books
        come up with some sort of way to rate genres' similarity

    books page:
        modify all books page to allow user to rate a book by clicking on it
        edit name of super long book names to be on multiple lines
        make books sortable by attribute

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        add error handling for when the user tries to add a genre that is already in their favs
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive
        make 'back' button so user can go back in the list of genres

    write tests

11:30am
    scrummed
    fixed ajax selector so that it selected the right element and passed the correct text to the db
    now working on using Jquery.remove to remove the genre button properly
    also the formatting for adding a new faved genre has gotten screwed up

12pm
    fixed ajax bugs - will have to rely on bootstrap to make formatting look nicer later
    MVP is complete!

1-2 lunch

2pm
    tinkering with algorithm
    discovered that only the genres:

    Nonfiction
    History
    Fantasy
    Historical Fiction
    Contemporary
    Young Adult
    Comics
    Graphic Novels

    have more than three books! This is not good for my rec algorithm.

3pm
    modified the spider to scrape all the pages of the list instead of just one
    realized a lot of the books on the following pages were just spam/fake books
    reseeded my database with a better goodreads list
    uncommented the ratings flask route = users can now rate books on the individual books page

4pm
    Playing with the genre rec algorithm
    there is an error with Historical where the flask route thinks it is Historical Fiction
    How do I get rid of Historical? It doesn't really seem to serve a purpose.
