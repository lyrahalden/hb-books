Goals -
write down hour by hour
take stretch breaks

To do:
    General:
        apply Henry's example to my reviews
        refactor flask routes to use Flask-login

    genres page:
        add genre graph using chart.js

    indiv books page:
        fix summary repeating problem

    books page:
        make books sortable by attribute
        fix how search looks
        make letters match regardless of capitalization
            use regex if time -- http://xion.io/post/code/sqlalchemy-regex-filters.html

    user page:
        add error handling for when user gets to the end of the genres?
        figure out how to clean up genre names - some are repetitive

    write tests

12pm
    scrummed
    successfully reseeded db with 1 page of highly rated books and many pages of mediumly rated books
    got jquery autocomplete to take me to the books page thanks to http://www.pontikis.net/blog/jquery-ui-autocomplete-step-by-step
    looks ugly, but will fix later
