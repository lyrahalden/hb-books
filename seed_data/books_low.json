Her reflections on her past form a vividly-etched chronicle of a girlhood shaped and dominated by her father; of a breakaway marriage to a virile but negligent farmer; of her complex ties to two sons - the conventional Marvin, and the flamboyant, adored John, whom she eventually destroys. Hagar in widowhood is still fiercely responsible, still armored by her steely humor, still isolated by her life-long habits of pride and self-reliance. But she does not remain untouched. In Hagar's ultimate self-confrontation, her final reckoning of the wages of love, Margaret Laurence has created one of contemporary literature's most stunning images of a woman's fate.", "THE STONE ANGEL is the first part of the acclaimed Manawaka series which also includes A Jest of God, The Fire-Dwellers, A Bird in the House, and The Diviners."]},

He is amusingly tolerant of his fellow Africans, thinking them uncivilized; he is obsessed with the idea of bringing \"civilization\" to this small jungle station. Johnson loves the white man's ways and cheerily adopts them; he has an enthusiasm that makes his boss Rudbeck overlook his rather vague office talents. This enthusiasm centers especially upon the construction of a road (symbol of civilization) and when Rudbeck has difficulty in getting funds from HQ, Johnson does some manipulation with the books. His peculiar sense of bookkeeping, together with his disdain for regulations, lands him in trouble. He gets the road built but is discharged. In despair and anger at being fired by his \"good friend\" Rudbeck, he gets drunk, and accidentally kills a white store owner. He is condemned to death. Rudbeck tries to save him, but \"justice\" cannot be reversed. Johnson is caught between two cultures, belonging no more to the new Africa than to the old. He begs Rudbeck, whom he looks upon as a father, to shoot him rather than let him be hanged by a stranger. Rudbeck, seeing him for the first time as an individual, grants this last request and ends the boy's life."]},

Why, then, would Jim Crace choose to retell it in strictly naturalistic, non-miraculous terms? The obvious answer would be that the godless novelist is trying to debunk divinity -- to take the entire New Testament down a notch. And at first, this does seem to be the case. Crace's Jesus first got religion as an adolescent, and 'was transformed by god like other boys his age were changed by girls'. His peers view his spiritual fervour as a youthful eccentricity. Even now, as the thirty-something Jesus heads out to the Judean desert for his forty-day retreat, he's perceived by his fellow anchorites as a flighty and impractical Galilean. They even call him 'Gally' for short -- and what sort of deity answers to a nickname? ", "Yet Crace is hardly the jeering materialist we might expect. As Jesus takes to his cliff-top cave, the author renders his religious transports without a hint of irony, and with a linguistic elegance that can hardly be called disrespectful: 'The prayers were in command of him. He shouted out across the valley, happy with the noise he made. The common words lost hold of sound. The consonants collapsed. He called on god to join him in the cave with all the noises that his lips could make. He called with all the voices in his throat.' And while most of the temptations of Christ are visited upon him by humans -- by the motley crew of his cave-dwelling neighbours -- he resists them with what we can only call superhuman will. ", "Quarantine", " does, of course, operate on a fairly realistic plane. Jesus dies of starvation long before his forty-day fast is complete, and his fellow retreatants, who take centre stage throughout much of the novel, are much too confused and brutal ever to figure in any Sunday school pageant. Still, Crace leaves at least the possibility of resurrection intact at the end, which should ensure that his brilliant book will rattle both believers and non-believers alike."]},

Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and--after his murder--three more with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

The perfect day turns to nightmare, however, when they are involved in freak ballooning accident in which a boy is saved but a man is killed. In itself, the accident would change the couple and the survivors' lives, filling them with an uneasy combination of shame, happiness, and endless self-reproach. But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed, making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa's London flat that very night. Soon he's openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins, \"I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain, across the road from me, with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable.\") Worst of all, Jed's version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe's feelings for Clarissa.

If only the wind hadn't picked up... If only he had saved Jed's 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare, his characters ineluctably swept up in others' fantasies, skidding into deepening violence, and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in de-familiarisation.

She has secretly devised a surgical procedure that could alter the lives of millions. When the beautiful and successful Valerie Dalton walks into Fletcher's office for a routine abortion, the doctor realizes that she has found the perfect experimental subject. Karen Chandler and her husband sought pregnancy for years with no success. They greet Fletcher's offer of a radically new procedure as a miracle. Karen, with no hesitation, agrees to undergo the clandestine surgery. When little Renata is born and then falls deathly ill, only one person can save her life. A woman who does not even know her daughter exists. Under a barrage of media scrutiny, Valerie Dalton must face the courts with her lover in an unprecedented custody battle. Ultimately, she plumbs the depths of her shattered soul to find the answer to the conflict that rages within her and all society. Solomon's Knife is a masterful and fiery mixture of medical thriller and courtroom drama that fuses every facet of the most violently debated issue of our age. The reality it foreshadows is only years -- perhaps months -- away. Praise for SOLOMON'S KNIFE: \"Solomon's Knife... is a species of that too-rare genus, moral fiction. But it is inhabited by real people instead of cut-outs stenciled with a specific point-of-view. I cared about these people even as I was swept up in the fascinating legal/ethical/moral conundrum they faced. Riveting, spellbinding, intellectually challenging, andemotionally satisfying.\" -- F. Paul Wilson ...\"an exciting page-turner sure to offend readers of all views.... Rousing pulp-fiction-cum social-prophecy.\" -- Kirkus ...\" 'transoption' would neatly put to rest all the outrage surrounding abortion.\" -- Publishers Weekly \"Gripping.... Solomon's Knife is a novel that does what only a great novel can do: It gives us a new context.\" -- Brad Linaweaver, Atlanta Journal-Constitution \"Solomon's Knife is that rare accomplishment, a philosophical novel with characters who seem like real people you can come to care about. Victor Koman has managed to fuse a serious, fair-minded, and sensitive explication of one of the more emotional issues of our time with a page-turner of a story.... Koman's novel will not only entertain readers, it will help those on all sides of the abortion issue clarify their thinking.\" -- Orange County Register \"Aptly named for the biblical story of King Solomon, this novel will be a welcome addition... in light of all the ethical questions it addresses.\" -- Library Journal Victor Koman has also written a screenplay of Solomon's Knife. He lives in southern California with his wife, Veronica, and daughter, Vanessa, as well as their cat, Kali. Koman graduated summa cum laude from Redlands University in 2001 as a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. In 2004, he received his MBA from Pepperdine University.
